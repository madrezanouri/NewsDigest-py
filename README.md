# NewsDigest-py
NewsDigest-Py is a compact Python project that fetches headlines or keyword-based articles from the News API, saves them as CSV/Excel, and then crawls each article URL to extract main text content. Itâ€™s perfect for quickly assembling your own dataset of news articles for research, NLP tasks, or data journalism.
